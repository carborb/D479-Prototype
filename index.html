        About The Island
    </p>
    <p>
        Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less than 500 square miles, the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous population of about 20,000.

        Until a recent increase in tourism, most the Tanitian economy was dominated by fishing or agriculture. Until recently, Taniti’s economy revolved mainly around fishing and agriculture, but a growing tourism industry has begun to reshape the island. The legal drinking age is 18, though enforcement is generally relaxed, and many younger Tanitians speak fluent English, making it easy for visitors to communicate in most urban areas; in rural regions, however, English is rarely spoken, especially by older residents. The island’s healthcare system includes one main hospital, staffed with many multilingual employees, along with several smaller clinics. Taniti uses the U.S. dollar as its primary currency, though euros and yen are also accepted in many places, and with banks offering currency exchange and most businesses taking major credit cards, travelers find it simple to manage their expenses.
